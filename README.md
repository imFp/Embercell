# Embercell
This is a solo game I worked on in Roblox back in 2020.

## About the game

Embercell was a game that I worked for 3 months back in 2020, from October to Janurary 2021.
I worked in this game all by myself, this was a coding challenge in Roblox, I would say this was the biggest step I made in my programming career.

## About the files

This doesn't include the full game scripts because there were so many, I got the main ones that I found, just to share the work.
The code is outdated and has deprecated functions, and bad usages.
Feel free to use the code for any studies (I don't really recommend LOL)
